- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @juliusbaechle
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming since the 8th class. I studied mechatronics as a dual student after school. 
      Since march 2021 I work as a software developer for WMF coffee machines. Currently I'm looking forward to study informatics.Cancel changes
- ðŸŒ± I learned a lot of different topics: first of all arduino (building selfmade quadrocopters, tuning looping louie, creating music sensible led-strips), 
      raytracing, cracking minesweeper by dll-injection and reverse-engineering.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by mail "julius.baechle@yahoo.de"
